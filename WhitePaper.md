# Infitnity AI Coin 

## Introduction

In the current world, AI products are dominating the digital space and there is a new concept of AI coins, which are utility coins or tokens made as utilities, governance tools or currencies which can be used in these platforms as a form of credit management. Also, these coins can also be used in many different ways possible (like swapping or being traded on CEX or DEX platforms). This document is a white paper explaining Infinity AI Coin, which has been created by the team behind AI startup called [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com). 

We're doing our best to keep our products open source and affordable and this needs investments. The best investor possible is the community in our minds and this is why for this particular time, we decided to launch an AI coin. 

The following is a full coverage of our products, our history and tokenomics of Infinity AI Coin.

## Background and history

Since the year 2020, we're working in the AI space with many different ideas and projects in different zones such as object detection, optical character recognition and since 2021, we switched to generative models with a focus on image generation and later, we switched to LLM development with focus on optimizing LLM's on Persian language. Currently, we have multiple products and one platform which lets people use all of them.
