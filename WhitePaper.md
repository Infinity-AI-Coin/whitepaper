# Infinity AI Coin 

## Introduction

In the current world, AI products are dominating the digital space and there is a new concept of AI coins, which are utility coins or tokens made as utilities, governance tools or currencies which can be used in these platforms as a form of credit management. Also, these coins can also be used in many different ways possible (like swapping or being traded on CEX or DEX platforms). This document is a white paper explaining Infinity AI Coin, which has been created by the team behind AI startup called [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com). 

We're doing our best to keep our products open source and affordable and this needs investments. The best investor possible is the community in our minds and this is why for this particular time, we decided to launch an AI coin. 

The following is a full coverage of our products, our history and tokenomics of Infinity AI Coin.

## Background and history

Since the year 2020, we're working in the AI space with many different ideas and projects in different zones such as object detection, optical character recognition and since 2021, we switched to generative models with a focus on image generation and later, we switched to LLM development with focus on optimizing LLM's on Persian language. Currently, we have multiple products and one platform which lets people use all of them. 

### Open Source Models

- [Musiqa (formerly known as Avasaz)](https://huggingface.co/avasaz)
- [Maral](https://huggingface.co/MaralGPT)
- [Sunsail AI (Partial Contribution)](https://huggingface.co/sunsailai)
- [Aqua Regia's Xei models](https://ollama.com/haghiri/xei)
- [Jabir Project](https://jabirproject.org)

### The Platform 

Most of the above models, adapters and fine-tunes are accessible through [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com)'s website and the majority of the products are free to use. 

## Blockchain and Consensus

Infinity AI Coin will be launched on The Open Network, which is a blockchain made by famous messenger application Telegram. We chose TON as our platform since it is fast and affordable and also have a community as big as telegram behind it. 

The Consensus algorithm is the same as TON, since we're just minting a token on this network. 

## Utility of The Token

Since we believe in the power of community and we need encouragement to keep our projects open source and also our platform affordable to use, this coin has been made to be a form of investment on our work. Actually community contributes to our project by trading this coin and making it alive. 

### Community Contribution

In our vision the community will be contributing in two ways: 

- Buying/Selling the coin 
- Providing the liquidity 

## Tokenomics

### Total supply 

Infinity AI coin will have a total supply of 21,000,000 coins. The reason behind that is first this is the same as bitcoin and second, when we keep our supplies as limited as possible, the coin can get more valuable for holders, traders and insiders. 

### Lock Up 

In order to keep a fair environment, one million tokens will be locked in a wallet on TON network with the address of UQCijPjf5tDu93k8-9XkrfnomCbGN0yOwzEEYAq9iA5ckuf2. Also the project's developer will hold one million tokens personally and avoids trading it for 90 days (or before the time the coin reaches $1m market cap.)

### Insiders 

Another One million tokens will be divided among 5 people we call "insiders". Each insider will receive 200,000 tokens and they will be chosen randomly. The insider strategy is to ask people to pariticipate in a small game on X (formerly twitter) and receive tokens just by chance. We do insider program this way to just make the community sure the majority will not be held by a single person or company. 

### Liquidity

The remaining 18,000,000 tokens will be listed on DeDust (the famous decentralized exchange of TON Network) with an initial liquidity of 5 TONs.

## Use of AI in process of making the coin

In process of making or miniting of the token AI isn't used. The token's logo is made using [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com)'s Gold model and in process of writing this white paper, we've got some help from platforms such as Claude or ChatGPT.
